# Student Grade Management System

A simple, command-line interface (CLI) application written in Python to manage student records, calculate grades, and analyze class performance. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and file handling using JSON.

##  Features

* **Add Student:** Register new students with Name, Roll Number, Marks, and Subject.
    * *Includes duplicate Roll Number detection.*
    * *Input validation for marks (0-100).*
* **Auto-Grading:** Automatically assigns a letter grade based on numerical marks.
* **View Records:** Display all students in a formatted tabular view.
* **Search:** Find specific students quickly using their Roll Number.
* **Update:** Modify marks for existing students (automatically updates the grade).
* **Delete:** Remove student records from the system.
* **Statistics:** View class insights including:
    * Class Average
    * Highest and Lowest scores
    * Pass Percentage
* **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves and loads data from a local file (`students_data.txt`), so records are not lost when the program closes.

##  Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
* No external libraries are required (uses standard `json` and `os` modules).

##  How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python installed:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
2.  Download `student_system_simple.py`.
3.  Run the script via terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    python student_system_simple.py
    ```

##  Grading Logic

The system applies the following grading scale based on input marks:

| Marks Range | Grade |
| :--- | :--- |
| 90 - 100 | **A+** |
| 80 - 89 | **A** |
| 70 - 79 | **B+** |
| 60 - 69 | **B** |
| 50 - 59 | **C** |
| 40 - 49 | **D** |
| Below 40 | **F** |

##  File Structure

* `student_system_simple.py`: The main source code file.
* `students_data.txt`: A JSON file automatically created by the program to store student records. *Do not edit this file manually to avoid data corruption.*

##  Future Improvements

Potential ideas to expand this project:
* Add support for multiple subjects per student.
* Export data to CSV or Excel format.
* Add password protection for the Delete/Update functions.
* Implement a GUI using `tkinter` or `PyQt`.
